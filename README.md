# Mixing
The Mixing method for maximum cut (MAXCUT) and maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) problem.

# Usage

```
./mixing [OPTIONS] INPUT
OPTIONS:
	-s SOLVER: type of solver
	           "-s maxcut" for maximum cut
	           "-s maxsat" for maximum SAT (default)
	-k RANK: rank of solution (default auto)
	         use "-k /2" to divide the rank by 2
	-e EPS: stopping threshold (default 1.0000e-03)
	-t MAX_ITER: maximum iteration (default 1000)
	             use "-t max" for INT_MAX
	-r N_TRIAL: number of trial in evaluation (default 1)
	-u: use unspeficied wcnf format
	-v: verbose

OUTPUTS:
	(factorized) SDP solution to INPUT.sol
	(when doing maxcut) rounded assignments to INPUT.rounding

NOTE:
	For better randomized rounding results for discrete MAXCUT / MAXSAT,
	pleases increase N_TRIAL (e.g., -r 10000).
